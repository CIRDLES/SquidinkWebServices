# SquidinkWebServices
Tomcat Servlet Components for Squidink

Servlet Components are built as a .war and included in [SquidInk-Image](https://github.com/RichardMcCarty1/SquidInk-Image) to be incorporated into a docker image for container servicing.

External packages are included / managed in pom.xml by Maven

Servlet Structure and end-point referencing are managed by [src/main/java/com/cirdles](https://github.com/RichardMcCarty1/SquidinkWebServices/tree/master/src/main/java/com/cirdles) and [src/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml](https://github.com/RichardMcCarty1/SquidinkWebServices/tree/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF) respectively
